1. Multiply transitive actions

import Mathlib.GroupTheory.GroupAction.Defs -- has class MulAction.IsPretransitive where exists_smul_eq (type may be empty)
import Mathlib.GroupTheory.GroupAction.Basic -- orbit relations
import Mathlib.GroupTheory.GroupAction.FixingSubgroup -- in the presence of `MulAction M α` (with `Group M`) it is the `Subgroup M` consisting of elements which fix `s : Set α` pointwise.

variable (G : Type u) {α : Type v} [Group G] [MulAction G α]

define action of FixingSubgroup x on the complement.

class MulAction.IsMultiplyTransitive 
Any action is 0-transitive.
An action on nonempty \alpha is (n+1)-transitive if it is transitive and for any x : \alpha, the action of FixingSubgroup x on the complement x^c is n-transitive.

Lemma: Let G act transitively on a set S. If H is normal in G, then the transitivity classes of the action, restricted to H, form a set of blocks for the action of G.

Proof: For two H-orbits T U, transitivity gives us g that sends an element of T to U, and normality makes this a bijection from T to U.

Lemma: Let G act primitively on a set S.  If H is normal in G, then either H is transitive of H is in the kernel of the action.

Theorem: If G acts primitively and faithfully on S, and the stabilizer of a point x is a simple group K, then any proper normal subgroup H is either trivial or acts simply
    transitively on S, and G is a semidirect product of H with K.

Proof: H \cap K is normal in K, so is either trivial or K.
We claim it is not K.  If it were, K \subseteq H, but transitivity means K is maximal, so H = K.  Since H then stabilizes x and is normal, then H stabilizes all points, so is trivial by faithfulness.
Now we have trivial intersection, so no non-identity element of H fixes x, and H acts freely and transitively on S.  Then, G is generated by H and K, since for any g, there is some h such that
hgx = x, meaning hg \in K.  This makes G a semidirect product.

Theorem: If G acts faithfully on S and the stabilizer K of a point x is simple, then the following hold:
1. If G is doubly transitive on S, and H is nontrivial proper normal, then H is elementary abelian, and K is a subgroup of GL_n(F_p), and G is a subgroup of AGL_n(F_p).
2. If G is triply transitive on S, and |S| > 3, then any nontrivial proper normal H is an elementary 2-group.
3. If G is quadruply transitive on S, and |S| > 4, then G is simple.

Proof: From the previous theorem, H is identified with S, and the doubly-transitive property means the conjugation action of K is transitive on H \ {1}.  Thus, H is elementary.
For part 2, if p > 2, then for any x \mapsto y, we must have 2x \mapsto 2y, contradicting double-transitivity on H\{0}. (note: if |S| = 3, we have G = S_3, K = S_2, H = A_3).
For part 3, GL_n(F_2) is not triply transitive on nonzero elements of F_2^n\{0} when n > 2, because it preserves planes. (if |S| = 4, we have G = S_4, K = S_3, H = V_4)

Corollary: Mathieu groups M_n are simple, for n = 21,22,23,24.

Proof: M_{21} = PSL_3(F_4).  The other M_n have M_{n-1} as point stabilizer and a triply transitive action on n elements.  Index is not a power of 2.

Corollary: A_n is simple for n \geq 5.

Proof: A_5 is simple.  All other A_n are (n-4)-transitive on n elements, with point stabilizer A_{n-1}.
